## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

‚Ä¢ A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
‚Ä¢ Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
‚Ä¢ Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
‚Ä¢ Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
‚Ä¢ Market price tracking.
‚Ä¢ Voice support for low-literate users.
‚Ä¢ Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

‚Ä¢ Small and marginal farmers
‚Ä¢ Agricultural extension officers
‚Ä¢ Government agriculture departments
‚Ä¢ NGOs and cooperatives
‚Ä¢ Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

‚Ä¢ 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
‚Ä¢ Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20‚Äì30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The government can identify and collaborate with successful farmers in each region to systematically collect their detailed practices on crop selection, fertilizers, pest management, irrigation methods, planting schedules, and cost-saving techniques. These best practices, proven in real-world conditions, will serve as a reliable knowledge base for other farmers.

This knowledge will then be digitized and integrated into a mobile application designed to be farmer-friendly and widely accessible. The app will:

Provide region-specific, practical guidance that reflects not only scientific inputs but also methods already validated by successful farmers in similar conditions.

Be available in multiple Indian languages, ensuring that farmers across diverse linguistic regions can benefit without facing language barriers.

Include step-by-step instructions, crop calendars, and fertilizer recommendations to help farmers follow clear, actionable steps rather than generic guidelines.

Feature AI-powered voice support, allowing even low-literacy farmers to access the same high-quality advisory services through simple voice interaction.

By combining farmer wisdom with digital technology, the app bridges the gap between traditional knowledge and modern advisory systems. This ensures that farmers receive trusted, localized, and easy-to-follow advice‚Äîknowledge that has already been successfully applied in their communities‚Äîthus improving adoption and long-term impact.

Do you want me to also add a short example scenario (like: ‚ÄúA farmer in Punjab growing wheat can see what top-performing farmers nearby do, with AI voice guiding him step by step‚Äù) to make it more relatable in your proposal?

Feature AI-powered voice support, which will act as a virtual farming assistant. This will allow farmers with low literacy levels to ask questions verbally and receive spoken guidance in their native language. The AI voice will explain farming practices, weather alerts, and fertilizer schedules in simple terms, ensuring inclusivity for farmers who may not be comfortable reading text on a smartphone.

## Technical Approach
The solution will be implemented in the following stages:
Data Collection and Validation
  Government collaborates with successful farmers in each region to collect detailed practices: crop selection, fertilizer usage, pest control, irrigation, planting schedules, and cost-saving techniques.
  Experts and agricultural officers validate the collected data to ensure reliability and scientific accuracy.
  Digitization and Knowledge Base Creation
  The validated practices are digitized and stored in a structured database.
  Data is tagged by region, crop type, soil type, and season to make the recommendations location-specific and practical.
Mobile Application Development
  A farmer-friendly mobile app is developed using Flutter/React Native for cross-platform availability.
  Features include: step-by-step guidance, crop calendars, fertilizer schedules, pest management tips, and region-specific advisory.
  The app will be available in multiple Indian languages for wide accessibility.
AI-Powered Voice Support
  Integration of AI voice assistants (Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text) to provide spoken instructions in local languages.
  Farmers can ask questions by speaking and receive voice-based answers, ensuring inclusivity for low-literate users.
  Voice-based alerts for weather updates, fertilizer reminders, and pest/disease control will keep farmers informed in real-time.
Continuous Feedback and Improvement
  Farmers can share feedback within the app (voice/text/image).
  The system will use this feedback loop to improve recommendations and update best practices regularly.
  Over time, the AI will become more accurate and regionally adaptive
## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility
Government Collaboration
Feasible since agriculture departments already have extension officers and networks to identify successful farmers.
Knowledge-sharing is cost-effective, as it leverages existing best practices instead of creating entirely new research.
Technology Readiness
Mobile app development using cross-platform frameworks (Flutter/React Native) is proven and affordable.
AI voice support can be implemented with existing APIs (Google, Microsoft, or open-source AI voice engines) in multiple Indian languages.
Cloud-based infrastructure ensures real-time access, scalability, and security.
Farmer Accessibility
